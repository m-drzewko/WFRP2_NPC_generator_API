# WFRP2_NPC_generator_API

## About

**This project is a work in progress**

This application is a passion project of mine. The idea arose from the need to create multiple non-player characters for a tabletop roleplaying game called Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (more specifically the second edition of this game). I decided it would be selfish to create such application only for personal use, so it's being created as a web application (that will additionally support two languages at launch).

This application is an API back-end NPC (non-player character) generator for the 2nd edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. It's designed to be used with a front-end Angular application that will handle the interaction with the users.

## Features

- Returns details of possible character races
- Generation of a random character based on race and gender

## To be implemented

- Distinugising marks generation (for all characters)
- Additional parameters for character generation (archetype, optional name)
- Random name generation (based on race and gender)
- Login functionality
- Ability for the user to save a generated charater on their account
